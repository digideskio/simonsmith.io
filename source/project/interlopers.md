As someone who dabbled in level design, Interlopers was a site I started out of frustration at the lack of a decent community and resource to contribute to. I launched the site just as Half-Life 2 was released and by getting some crucial content first, the community begun to grow quite rapidly.

I have been responsible for front-end development, content writing, community management and other general tasks. The site was [designed by a member of the community](http://jasard.co.uk/) and modified extensively by myself as the site has progressed. To power the back-end, Interlopers is heavily integrated into [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/), courtesy of another developer from the community to assist with PHP development. A good example of this integration is found in [the portfolios section](http://www.interlopers.net/portfolios) which has proved a hit with the user base.

The site continues to receive a large slice of traffic and is highly regarded in the level design community as a source of information. In fact, many of the members have gone on to have professional careers in game development.

Future tasks include a complete responsive re-write using the [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) framework which is currently under way and [can even be previewed](http://stage.interlopers.net/).

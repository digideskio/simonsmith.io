    Shopa is a startup in East London, building an online social marketplace

    I have primarily worked on improving the architecture of the site, as well as adding new front-end features. Notable additions:

    * Move to [SUIT CSS with Stylus](https://github.com/simonsmith/suitcss-with-stylus/) and re-factor the site to be more component based
    * Structure the JavaScript with [Flight](http://flightjs.github.io/) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
    * Add [gulp](gulpjs.com) into the Rails pipeline to build SUIT and Flight components

    Interlopers was started in 2004 out of my frustration at the lack of a decent community and resource to contribute to. It has grown to become one of the leading level design communities for Half-Life 2 and other Source powered games.

    I have been responsible for front-end development, content writing, community management and other general tasks. The site is written in PHP and is heavily integrated into [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/).

    Shopa is a startup in East London, building an online social marketplace

    I primarily worked on improving the front-end architecture of the site, as well as adding new features. Notable additions:

    * Move to [SUIT CSS with Stylus](https://github.com/simonsmith/suitcss-with-stylus/) and re-factor the site to be more component based
    * Structure the JavaScript with [Flight](http://flightjs.github.io/) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
    * Add [gulp](gulpjs.com) into the Rails pipeline to build SUIT and Flight components

    Interlopers was started in 2004 out of my frustration at the lack of a decent community and resource to contribute to. It has grown to become one of the leading level design communities for Half-Life 2 and other Source powered games.

    I have been responsible for front-end development, content writing, community management and other general tasks. The site is written in PHP and is heavily integrated into [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/).

    One of the first projects at [Immediate Media](http://www.immediate.co.uk/) to be have a mobile first responsive design.

    I came into the project early on and was tasked with re-factoring the front-end and setting a good foundation for the site.

    Working with another front-end developer, we structured a modular front-end, broken up into various Sass files that allowed easy re-use of code across the site. I also structured and wrote a lot of the JS, making use of the [Primish](https://github.com/DimitarChristoff/primish) library

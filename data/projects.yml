    Shopa is a startup in East London, building an online social marketplace

    I primarily worked on improving the front-end architecture of the site, as well as adding new features. Notable additions:

    * Move to [SUIT CSS with Stylus](https://github.com/simonsmith/suitcss-with-stylus/) and re-factor the site to be more component based
    * Structure the JavaScript with [Flight](http://flightjs.github.io/) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
    * Add [gulp](gulpjs.com) into the Rails pipeline to build SUIT and Flight components

    One of the first projects at [Immediate Media](http://www.immediate.co.uk/) to be have a mobile first responsive design.

    I came into the project early on and was tasked with re-factoring the front-end and setting a good foundation for the site.

    Working with another front-end developer, we structured a modular front-end, broken up into various Sass files that allowed easy re-use of code across the site. I also structured and wrote a lot of the JS, making use of the [Primish](https://github.com/DimitarChristoff/primish) library

    Policy Expert is an insurance product from [QMetric](http://qmetric.co.uk/)

    It used a completely new design (sourced externally) developed with a mobile first responsive approach and used WordPress to power the content.

    We chose to use [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) as the main technologies and implemented as much of [the SMACSS approach](http://smacss.com/) as possible.
    The site uses a fluid layout and uses media queries to tweak content positioning at various screen sizes.

    The QMetric site was originally designed and built by an external agency. However, due to the lack of responsive design and out of date front-end practices I rebuilt the site as a side project.

    [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) was used on this project, not only for the ease of code organisation but also to conditionally load assets based on the device size such as the Google map on larger devices only. This helped with performance and usability.

    The source of the site [is also viewable on GitHub](https://github.com/qmetric/qmg-website).

    Interlopers was started in 2004 out of my frustration at the lack of a decent community and resource to contribute to. It has grown to become one of the leading level design communities for Half-Life 2 and other Source powered games.

    I have been responsible for front-end development, content writing, community management and other general tasks. The site is written in PHP and is heavily integrated into [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/).

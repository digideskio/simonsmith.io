    BBC Three was moved from a television channel to an online proposition in
    February 2016. It's built on Node and renders React components on
    the client and server.

    A few of my responsibilities:

    * Architecting a component based UI with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
      [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and SUIT CSS.
    * Building and maintaining a component library for reuse within the BBC.
    * Cross browser testing on a wide variety of devices.
    * Unit testing React components with shallow rendering.
    * Optimising script loading with [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and
      various other performance tweaks.

    SUIT is styling methodology for component-based UI development that was
    created by [Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/) and used at
    Twitter.

    I contribute as a core maintainer, triaging issues and working on new
    features. Some notable additions include:

    * Adding a cross browser tested [Flexbox utilty](https://github.com/suitcss/utils-flex)
    * Re-factoring the existing [Grid component](https://github.com/suitcss/components-grid)
      to use Flexbox
    * Replacing Rework with PostCSS in the [SUIT CSS preprocessor](https://github.com/suitcss/preprocessor)
      and adding additional features

    Shopa is a startup in East London, building an online social marketplace.

    I primarily worked on the front-end, including architecting and rebuilding
    the site to match a new design. This included:

    * Developing modular UI components with [SUIT CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/)
    * Structuring the JavaScript with [Flight JS](http://flightjs.github.io/) and
    [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
    * Adding [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) into the Rails pipeline to build SUIT and
    Flight components

    Led UI development on the re-build of the Radio Times website at BBC
    worldwide and later maintained it again whilst at Immediate Media.

    Starting over on the new site allowed use of various modern development
    practices at the time, such as parts of HTML5 and CSS3. The TV and Radio
    listings page was built with a collection of modular MooTools classes to
    power the navigation of the grid.
- title: Top Gear

  text: |
    One of my main tasks on the Top Gear site was a complete re-build of the
    home page, as well as implementing a new global header and footer onto all
    other sections. I worked [with another UI
    developer](http://www.alecrust.com/) to completely architect the front-end
    code from scratch.

    As well as this project I was also responsible for maintaining the Top Gear
    WordPress blogs, which largely involved integrating new design features.

    Policy Expert is an insurance product from [QMetric](http://qmetric.co.uk/).

    It used a completely new design (sourced externally) developed with a mobile
    first responsive approach and used WordPress to power the content.

    We chose to use [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and
    [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) as the main technologies and implemented
    as much of [the SMACSS approach](http://smacss.com/) as possible.  The site
    uses a fluid layout and uses media queries to tweak content positioning at
    various screen sizes.

    The QMetric site was originally designed and built by an external agency.
    However, due to the lack of responsive design and out of date front-end
    practices, I rebuilt the site as a side project.

    [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) was used on this project, not only for the
    ease of code organisation but also to conditionally load assets based on the
    device size such as the Google map on larger devices only. This helped with
    performance and usability.

    The source of the site [is also viewable on
    GitHub](https://github.com/qmetric/qmg-website).

  text: |
    One of the first projects at [Immediate Media](http://www.immediate.co.uk/)
    to be have a mobile first responsive design.

    I came into the project early on and was tasked with re-factoring the
    front-end and setting a good foundation for the site.

    Working with another front-end developer, we structured a modular front-end,
    broken up into various Sass files that allowed easy re-use of code across
    the site. I also structured and wrote a lot of the JS, making use of the
    [Primish](https://github.com/DimitarChristoff/primish) library.

  text: |
    Interlopers was started in 2004 out of my frustration at the lack of a
    decent community and resource to contribute to. It has grown to become one
    of the leading level design communities for Half-Life 2 and other Source
    powered games.

    I have been responsible for front-end development, content writing,
    community management and other general tasks. The site is written in PHP and
    is heavily integrated into [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/).

After a recent PC upgrade I decided that I was sick of staring at the Windows 7 Aero theme.

To my delight, all that is needed is a bit of patience and some spare time to make Windows 7 visually suck less.

## First, the goal

Try and tell me you *don’t* want this in your life:

<figure class="Post-imgContainer">
    <a class="Post-imgLink js-imgPop" href="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/wallpaper1.jpg">
        <img class="Post-imgElem" src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/wallpaper1-1024x576.jpg">
    </a>
</figure>

## Ingredients

You will need:

*   [RocketDock][1]
*   [Simple Dark][2] (theme for RocketDock)
*   [Windows 7 Glass Onion Theme][3]
*   [Lucid Icons][4]
*   [Sexy lady][5]

## Setup

Get the Glass onion theme installed first.

Fortunately the theme provides detailed documentation and literally every tool you need to install the various files. But you will be overriding a few crucial Windows files so ensure you backup!

Provided that has gone successfully, the most time consuming part will be creating application short cuts, dragging them on to RocketDock and then changing each icon.

One thing I noticed here is that the Simple Dark theme has a slight bug that seemed to stop me dragging icons on to it. Just select a different theme to get everything set-up and then switch back when you’re done.

## RocketDock settings

Here are the settings I used for the RocketDock setup pictured:

        <img class="Post-imgElem" src="/assets/images/uploads/2011/08/dock-settings1.jpg">
    </a>
</figure>

Bask in the minimalism!
